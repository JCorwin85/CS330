How do I approach designing software?
This was a very new concept for me and I had to take it step by step line by line.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I have been able to create a 3D scene and implement camera movement.  A thing I would have never guess I could manage.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
A slow methodical approach worked best for me.  

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I am applying for a software engineer position at BAE and had an interview where the lead stated that they are programming interfaces.  This class would be helpful if I had to create visuals.

How do I approach developing programs?
I conduct alot of research into different methods and approaches that I can take.  

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I really appriciated that the modules in this class built upon each other.  It made the final project managable and I will use this approach in the future.

How did iteration factor into your development?
It was extremely helpful.  I was able to finish one portion at a time and built upon it to produce the final product.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
As I stated a slow methodical approach is most useful to me.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
It is my field of work and necessary if I am going to grow as a software engineer.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I learned a new aspect of coding that was previously unknown.  This taught me that I can learn new difficult concepts.
